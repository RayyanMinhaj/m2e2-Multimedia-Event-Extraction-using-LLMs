A Second Night of Chicago Protests Over Police Shooting Protesters took to the streets of Chicago for the second straight night Wednesday, one day after the city's police department released video of a black teenager being shot to death by a white officer.

Van Dyke was arrested Tuesday and charged with murder.
They also showed pictures of black people who had been killed by police in recent years and called on people to prevent similar tragedies from happening again.
