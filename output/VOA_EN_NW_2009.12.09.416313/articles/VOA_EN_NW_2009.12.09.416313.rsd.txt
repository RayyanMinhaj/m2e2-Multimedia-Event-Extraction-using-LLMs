 UNECA Director Says Dangers in Guinea are Serious The director of governance at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa says the current crisis in Guinea is a reflection of the internal conflict within the military. Bodies of people killed during a rally are seen at the capital's main mosque in Conakry, Guinea Okey Onyejekwe warns that the entire West African region will be destabilized if Guinea becomes a failed state. The talks were intended to reduce escalating tensions following a failed assassination attempt last week on the junta leader. Guinea's military junta Onyejekwe said there are signs of disagreement within the ranks of the junta. Dadis Camara himself is a captain, but the issue here to me is a lot lager than that. Some political analysts believe suspension of the crisis talks undermines efforts by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to resolve the political crisis. But Onyejekwe says there has been resistance over the choice of Burkina Faso President Blaise Campoare as mediator of the crisis. He also expressed the hope that both the African Union and ECOWAS will intensify efforts to organize elections to ensure a return to constitutional rule.
